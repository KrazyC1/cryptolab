I have an idea for a program i'd like to make. The idea I had was to build a web app that allows you to place and connect various blocks that perform different cryptographic functionality. With this idea I could create the encryption side of AES for example. I could also create the decryption side and pipe the ciphertext over for it to be handled properly, also allowing the user to enter in values for test input. I want the web app functionality to take place entirely within the app itself on the user's machine, I do not want to have the user making requests to an external server to run the code. I am thinking HTML/React for the front end and javascript for the backend. I want the different parts of the program to be seperate files for ease of editing it later.
