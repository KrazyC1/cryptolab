make me a simple web app using html/css as the front end (index.html and style.css) and javascript as the backend (script.js) that allows users to select and drag various different colored blocks (almost like a palette) on the left side of the screen (within a panel) and place different colored blocks on screen. Please utilize as many libraries as you can to make it simpler
