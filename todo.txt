I will provide my current code for my web app. Can you make it so there is a button on screen that lets you create a wire connection between two blocks. When clicking the Create Wire button it should show the wire-able points on all the blocks present on the canvas. Example: There are two blocks on the canvas, clicking the "Create Wire" button shows 4 points on the first block and 4 points on the second block. For a reference of what I have in mind check the image below. When a user selects a point on the first block and then one on the second block it will then create the wire. Here is all my code and the example image file depicting the wire:
