From the code I think you can agree that the input/output points are in a similar location to where the triangles are. In the case of a triangle being present I do not want the point to be shown upon clicking the "Create Wire" button simple as that, I do not want you to remove the code that hides all input and output points either as it serves as a way of toggling between wire view mode and normal mode!
